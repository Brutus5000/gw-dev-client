# gw-dev-client
A developer client for the [FAF Galactic War backend](https://github.com/FAForever/gw-backend).

This is not the official client to play FAF Galactic War. It's functional but it's no fun. You might say it's ugly. This client is intended for debugging and testing purposes only. It also serves as a reference implementation for the dedicated web frontend.
